# whileAndIf

During my studies, I completed an exercise that involved developing an algorithm with the following specifications:

Implementing a loop to repeatedly ask the user for a number.
Checking each number to determine if it is positive, negative, or zero.
Returning a corresponding message based on the number's classification.

The exercise aimed to reinforce my understanding of loops, user input, and conditional statements in Java. By completing this exercise, I gained hands-on experience in developing a program that interacts with the user and provides meaningful output based on input conditions
